## **📊 Data Insights**  
The dataset contains **India’s population distribution (2022)** categorized by age groups.  

🔹 **Largest Age Group:** 15–19 years (9.1%)  
🔹 **Workforce-Dominant Age Groups (20–44 years):** ~31.7%  
🔹 **Elderly Population (60+ years):** ~8.7%  
🔹 **Declining Population Share in Older Groups** highlights potential demographic shifts.  
🔹 **0-4 Age Group (6.8%)** suggests a slight decline in birth rates compared to past trends.  

### **📢 Key Observations:**  
✔ **Economic Growth Potential** – A large working-age population supports industrial and economic expansion.  
✔ **Healthcare Considerations** – A relatively small aging population minimizes dependency but may change over time.  
✔ **Policy Focus** – Educational and employment strategies should target the 15–29 age group for maximum impact.
